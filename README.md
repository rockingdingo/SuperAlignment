# SuperAlignment package

This is the official github repo of pypi package SuperAlignment (https://pypi.org/project/SuperAlignment). 

Motivated by OpenAI's alignment paper "WEAK-TO-STRONG GENERALIZATION: ELICITING STRONG CAPABILITIES WITH WEAK SUPERVISION"(https://openai.com/index/weak-to-strong-generalization/), we feel that it's a very interesting direction to define some common interface to train/eval superalignment models in this new area. Right now it has just started from scratch and you are very welcome to contact us if you have any cool ideas that would like to participate and collabratively commit to this repo. 


```
pip install SuperAlignment
```


```
import SuperAlignment as sa
xxx
```
